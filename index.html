                            <p>There are 3 main types of certificates you can choose from for your site:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Domain Validation <em>(DV)</em>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Standard SSL (Just as secure as other options).</li>
                                        <li>Free via Let's Encrypt &amp; Cloudflare, or purchase available.</li>
                                        <li>Normally issued in minutes.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Oranization Validation <em>(OV)</em>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Shows organization within certificate but largly appears the same as DV.</li>
                                        <li>Requires purchase.</li>
                                        <li>Can take several days to issue.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Extended Validation <em>(EV)</em>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Shows oranization in url bar as well as within the certificate.</li>
                                        <li>Requires purchase, more expensive.</li>
                                        <li>Can take up to a week to issue.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>For most sites, DV certificates are exactly what you're looking for. But it's worth considering EV certificates as they show the organization in the url bar.</p>
                            <p>Another consideration is do you need this certificate for a single domain/subdomain or for multiple. There are single domain, multi domain and wildcard (all subdomains) certificates available from most SSL providers, though Let's Encrypt &amp; Cloudflare require you setup each subdomain seperatly.</p>

                            <p>If you're just looking to secure your main domain a 1 or 2 DV certificates will work perfectly.
                                <br>Free DV certificates are available with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>

                                and <a target="_blank" href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>.</template>
                                <br>Many sites such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ssls.com/">SSLs.com</a>
                                    <template v-if="control == 'max'"> or <a target="_blank" href="https://sslmate.com/">SSLmate</a></template> offer certifciates.</p>
                            <p>If you're interested in an OV or EV certificate, best to go ahead and purchase these in advance as they can take several days to be issued. They will also require proof of the organization's existence. But if you're selecting a DV certificate then you can wait till the moving day.</p>
                            <p>Once you've selected the certificate you're interesed in you can move on to start migrating, but consider the following points to make sure you don't miss anything.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Could you migrate first on a test site?</h3>
                            <p>If you are able to, first setting up a test / staging version of your site to migrate would ease the process greately as it reduces risk while making changes to the production site. This is optional as most sites don't have access to a test site, nor will many sites actually require one anyway.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Dedicate some time to your migration</h3>
                            <p>Installing a certificate can be pretty quick, though the actual full migration process can take a good chunk of time to properly complete. We'd advise starting the moving day portion of this guide when you have a few hours free. If everythign goes smoothly it may take much less time, but it's worth having that spare time just in case.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>How will you track changes</h3>
                            <p>In the event that the migration causes some short term distruptions in traffic and/or search rank, you'll want stats to fall back on and provide visibility of what exactly changed.</p>
                            <p>If you havent already, setup <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> or a similar service and let it run for at least a week to get a good idea of current traffic &amp; behaviour.</p>
                            <p>It's also worth making sure you have <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Search Console</a> (Webmaster tools) setup to track indexed pages and keywords used to find your site along with average position. You may also want to check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster">Bing's Webmaster Tools</a>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Consider making some changes pre migration</h3>
                            <p>Some changes such as fixing mixed content can often be done before the move.
                                <br>We've listed it later on as part of the migration flow, but feel free to skip ahead through the guide to ease the changes later.
                                <br>Other changes such as redirects &amp; 3rd party changes must wait 'til you first have SSL installed.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Do you plan to move your entire site or just specific areas first?</h3>
                            <p>If you can, moving your entire site. It means more work up front but given the SEO benifits and knowelege that your entire site is encrypted for users is worth it.</p>
                            <p>However, not all sites are able to do this at one, at the very least you'll need to setup HTTPS for any login forms, payment pages and any pages that require or reveal user details.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Does you site have multiple variations?</h3>
                            <p>During the migration you'll need to be aware of all variations of your site such as multiple lanages or location based changes or even AB tests in progress? During the mixed content fixing step you'll need to check all variations.</p>

                            <p>You should make a note of when your certificate expires on a calander to be safe. Even if you've setup automatic renewal of the certificate with lets encrypt, you may still want to be alerted to check it's worked. With other SSL providers, they normally email you before renewal but best to be safe and keep track of this date yourself. If you had to install the certificate yourself, consider making notes on how you did this for your future self to use.</p>
